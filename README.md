# Bank Loan Report Dashboard

This project involved a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data, from database creation to the development of an interactive dashboard. The process began with building a relational database using SQL to store and manage the raw data. Python was then utilised to perform in-depth data analysis, cleaning, and transformation. Finally, a dynamic and interactive dashboard was created in Power BI to visualise key metrics, trends, and insights related to loan performance. This project demonstrates proficiency in data management, analysis, and visualisation using a robust technical stack.

# Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following key tools and technologies:

- SQL (Structured Query Language): Leveraged for building and managing the relational database that served as the project's data source.

- Microsoft Power BI Desktop: The primary business intelligence platform used for the entire dashboard creation process.

- Power Query: Utilised for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis and visualisation.

- Data Modelling: Used to define relationships between different tables in the dataset, create hierarchies, and set up calculations. This ensures that the data works together seamlessly and that visualisations are accurate.

- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create custom measures, calculated columns, and tables, allowing for advanced analysis and dynamic calculations within the dashboard.

- Power View: This component is used to design and build the interactive charts, graphs, and other visual elements of the dashboard.

- File Format: .pbix for development and .png for dashboard preview.

# Business Problems
- The project was designed to address the lack of a comprehensive, centralised report to monitor and assess the bank's lending activities and performance.

- It was difficult to gain insights into loan-related metrics and their changes over time, which hindered data-driven decisions and effective tracking of the loan portfolio's health.

- The bank needed to identify trends to inform its lending strategies.

# Goal of the Dashboard
The main goal was to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report to provide insights into key loan metrics. This report is divided into three main sections:

- Summary Dashboard: To monitor and assess lending performance through key performance indicators (KPIs) and to distinguish between "Good Loans" and "Bad Loans" based on loan status criteria.

- Overview Dashboard: To visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends using various chart types, such as line charts, filled maps, donut charts, and bar charts.

- Details Dashboard: To provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing detailed loan data and offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related information.

# Key Values
The dashboard focuses on several key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide a clear view of the loan portfolio:
- Financial Metrics: The dashboard tracks the total number of loan applications, total funded amount, and total amount received from borrowers. It also includes Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes for these metrics to show performance over time.

- Risk Metrics: The average interest rate and average Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio are calculated and tracked to gauge the overall cost and financial health of the borrowers.

- Loan Status: The dashboard distinguishes between 'Good Loans' (with a status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current') and 'Bad Loans' (with a status of 'Charged Off') to assess the quality of the loan portfolio. KPIs for each category include the percentage, total applications, and funded amount.

# Impact and Insights
- Informing Lending Strategies: By showing trends over time and breakdowns by loan purpose, term, and borrower demographics (e.g., employment length, home ownership), the dashboard helps the bank identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities.

- Improving Risk Assessment: It provides data to evaluate borrower creditworthiness and predict default probabilities, which helps determine appropriate interest rates and lending terms.

- Optimising Portfolio Management: The visual reports help banks monitor the overall health of their loan portfolios and identify underperforming loans. This enables data-driven decision-making, such as approving or denying loan requests.

- Detecting Fraud and Ensuring Compliance: The analysis of loan data can help detect unusual patterns or inconsistencies that might indicate fraudulent activity. It also helps with regulatory compliance by ensuring loan data is collected and reported as mandated by regulations.
